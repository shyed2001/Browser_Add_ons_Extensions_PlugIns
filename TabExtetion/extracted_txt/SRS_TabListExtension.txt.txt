📑 Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project Title: OpenTabListInfoRestoreExtension (v2.0 Roadmap) Status: Consolidated Requirements (Academic/Professional Grade)

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document defines the complete functional and non-functional requirements for the OpenTabList extension, aggregating all features from basic tab saving to advanced AI-driven research assistance.

1.2 Scope
The system acts as a hybrid between a Bookmark Manager, Research Database, and Session Restore tool. It caters to users in Engineering, Science, Business, and Finance by providing deep logging and metadata for web-based activities.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Core Tab Management
FR-1: Session Capture: Must capture Tab Name, URL, and metadata for all active tabs in a window.

FR-2: Duplicate Prevention: Use URL as a primary key. No duplicate entries; instead, increment a repeatCount.

FR-3: RGYB Visual Logic: Implement a Red-Yellow-Green-Blue (RGYB) tick/star system to indicate link frequency.

FR-4: Temporal Logging: Append timestamps to a list for every repeat save action rather than overwriting.

2.2 Data Management (DBMS)
FR-5: Local Storage: Utilize a local JSON-based storage system (Chrome Storage API).

FR-6: Global Search: Provide a dashboard-level search for links, titles, and notes.

FR-7: Notes Engine: Allow users to add "General" and "Per Link" notes that persist in the database.

FR-8: Multi-Format Export: Support "Save As" for .json, .csv, .html, and .txt.

2.3 Advanced Content Recognition
FR-9: Domain Specific Extraction:

YouTube: Extract spatial features/video details.

Social Media: Track FB/Social action links and activity patterns.

FR-10: Bookmark Integration: One-click option to add saved links to the native Browser Bookmark manager.

2.4 Future Technical Ecosystem (Roadmap)
FR-11: Cross-Platform Sync: Interaction with Desktop and Mobile apps via centralized Login/Subscription.

FR-12: Password/Task Management: Integrated vault for credentials and a built-in task manager for research workflows.

FR-13: Sandbox/VM Features: Ability to test/load links in a Blackbox/Sandbox environment for security.

FR-14: AI Research Agent: Intelligent agent for smart search and business solution suggestions based on saved links.

3. Data Requirements
3.1 Schema Definition
Each entry must contain: | Field | Type | Description | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | id | UUID | Unique identifier | | title | String | Tab title | | url | URL | Primary Link | | timestamps | Array | List of all save events | | repeatCount | Integer | Total save frequency | | notes | String | User commentary | | metadata | Object | Domain-specific info (YouTube, FB, etc.) |

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance & Monitoring
NFR-1: Performance Monitor: Integrated dashboard showing extension resource usage.

NFR-2: Network Monitor: Log network activity associated with saved tabs.

NFR-3: Error Reporting: Automatic bug/log setup for developer donation/support links.

4.2 Security
NFR-4: Encryption: Password-protected access to the dashboard.

NFR-5: Privacy: "Show the place of stored data" option for transparency.

4.3 UI/UX Design
NFR-6: Themes: Support for multiple CSS themes and font styles.

NFR-7: Responsive GUI: Dashboard must function on mobile viewports for remote data review.

5. Development Strategy (SDLC)
Phase A (Complete): Core architecture and basic popup.

Phase B (Current): RGYB Logic, Local DBMS, HTML Dashboard.

Phase C (Next): Social Media interaction, Note-taking expansion, Search optimization.

Phase D (Future): AI Integration, Cross-Platform sync, Security Sandboxing. </markdown:Project SRS:SRS_Document.md>

Summary of Consolidation
User Manual: Written to be accessible for non-technical users in your professional fields (Finance, HRM, Engineering).

SRS: I have taken the "massive list" of features you provided—from YouTube spatial features to AI agents and VM Sandboxes—and categorized them into a structured roadmap.

Data Integrity: The SRS explicitly includes your requirement for Read-Only exports vs Active JSON DB and the RGYB color progression.
