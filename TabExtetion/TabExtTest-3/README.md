🌐 OpenTabList Info Restore - User Guide

Welcome to your advanced research and session management companion. This extension is designed to turn your messy browser tabs into a structured, searchable, and permanent database.



🛠 1. Installation

Since this is currently a developer-build extension, follow these steps:



Download the extension folder to your computer.



Open Google Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser).



Navigate to chrome://extensions/.



Switch the Developer mode toggle (top right) to ON.



Click Load unpacked and select the extension folder.



Pin the extension icon to your toolbar for easy access.



💾 2. Saving Your Tabs

Whenever you are working on a project, click the extension icon and select "Save Current Tabs to DB".



What happens: The extension captures every open tab in your current window.



Intelligent Tracking: If you have saved a link before, the extension won't create a duplicate. Instead, it adds a "Repeat Mark" and logs the new time you visited it.



📊 3. The Dashboard (Your Research Hub)

Click "Open HTML Dashboard" in the popup to manage your history.



Search: Use the search bar to find links by title, URL, or your personal notes.



Notes: Click in the "Notes" column to add context to any link (e.g., "Source for Section A").



Open: Click "Open" to launch a saved link in a new tab.



Delete: Remove individual entries you no longer need.



🌈 4. Understanding Repeat Indicators (RGYB)

We use a color-coded system to show you how often you revisit certain resources:



🔴 Red Tick (✔): 1st Repeat.



🟡 Yellow Tick (✔): 2nd Repeat.



🟢 Green Tick (✔): 3rd Repeat.



🔵 Blue Tick (✔): 4th Repeat.



★ Red Star: 5th Repeat (Consolidates previous ticks).



★✔... Star + Ticks: Shows visits beyond 5.



📥 5. Exporting Data

Your data is stored safely in your browser's local database. You can export it for "Read-Only" use in three formats:



JSON: Best for developers or backups.



CSV: Open in Excel or Google Sheets for data analysis.



HTML: A beautiful, standalone report you can share or keep as a document.



Note: Your data is private. It is stored locally on your machine and is never sent to a cloud server unless you choose to export it. </markdown:User Documentation:User\_Guide.md>
